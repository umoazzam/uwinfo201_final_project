**Domain of interest:** Racial and geographical breakdown of juvenile crime in America

**Why we chose this domain:** News and media often portray crime, including juvenile crime, in a way that is favorable to the network or the parent company. Often, what is reported has bias depending on the background of the reporting company. Analyzing the raw data from juvenile crime will give finite numbers and provide thorough and important numbers that describe the true nature of juvenile crime in America, as well as societal biases and discrimination that may influence juvenile rates between locations, and among racial and ethnic diasporas. Examining data that can potentially shine a light on sources of discrimination in America allows us to begin a conversation on *how we as a community can counteract discrimination*, making this an extremely important and relevant topic to our group.

**Examples of crime-based data analysis:**

* [Crime Data Explorer](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/), a government driven project, displays a geovisualization on various sets of data including *crime, arrest and etc*. in different states in the US from 2007-2018. Users can select a type of data set and a state from the drop down menu to see a broad range of statistics of crime such as *victim demographics* and *violent crimes offense characteristics*.
* [Crime Map](https://cityprotect.com/), a map showing the locations where incidents occur during the selected range of time. Different icons represent different types of incidents. Users can click filter to customize data range and types of incidents they would like to see, and can also click on the icons for further detailed information about that incident including *time of occurrence, case number and etc*. 
* [Mug Shots](https://mugshots.tampabay.com/), a crime search engine to search criminals in Hillsborough, Pinellas, Manatee and Pasco counties. By putting a *name* into the searching bar or selecting from one of the six categories (*county, age, height, eyes, genders*), the pictures and information of the criminals will show up.

**Interesting research questions:**

* What types of crime do different police departments arrest the most? (filtering for most common category of crime)
* What types of crime are more prevalent in different regions of the country? (grouping by location and filtering for most common category of crime)
* What are the demographics of juvenile offenders and what types of crime do they commit? (analyzing options for demographic category and its correlation to crime category)

**Data sources:**

* [Juvenile Crime](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/downloads-and-docs), The data is from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Some data from 2018 to September 2019 is also from the UCR program. Data is broken down by state. 
    * Contains 690 rows and 27 columns.
    * This data set can directly answer our questions about juvenile crime, and types of crime that different age groups most commonly engage with.
* [U.S. Metro Areas Violent Crime Rated by Type, 1975-2015](https://data.world/carlvlewis/u-s-metro-areas-violent-crime-rates-by-type-1970-2015), The data is from data.world by user Carl V. Lewis. From their description, their data points are collected from the UCR FBI databases. Additionally, in the data itself, there are columns for the data’s source and URL. A few rows are directly from police departments and government websites.
    * Contains 2,828 rows and 17 columns.
    * This data set can answer our question about police department arrests and potentially about crime in different regions.
* [Crime in the U.S. by Region, Geographic Divison, and State](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/topic-pages/tables/table-2), This comes from the UCR (Uniform Crime Reporting) agency. They collected data from states that submitted their rape data--that aligned to the UCR’s definition of rape, offenses reported by the Metro Transit Police, and the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services. Additionally, the population data are derived from the US Census Bureau from reports from July 1, 2016. 
    * Contains 214 rows and 23 columns
    * This can directly answer our question about the geographic breakdown of crime.
